description: >-
  Simulates visibilities from a given skymodel and uses the result to clip bright sources from the data.
  Because this steps performs prediction, options of the Predict step are also valid.
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step.
    default: clipper
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'clipper'.
    default: clipper
  amplmax:
    type: float
    doc: >-
      Sets the clip level for the data.
    default: 50.0 for LBA, 5.0 for HBA
  timestep:
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Perform the visibility prediction only once every `time_step` steps.
      The next `time_step - 1` will use these visibilities until the next prediction.
    default: 5
  flagallcorrelations:
    type: boolean
    default: True
    doc: >-
        Flag all correlations for a baseline if a single correlation exceeds `amplmax`.
  freqstep:
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Perform the visibility prediction only once every `frequency_step` channels.
      The next `frequency_step - 1` channels will use these visibilities until the next prediction.
