  The IDGImager step it is an experimental step to produce snapshots images of an AARTFAAC observation at each time step.
  It leverages the Image Domain Gridder library (https://git.astron.nl/RD/idg).

inputs:
  image_size:
    default: 1024
    type: integer
    doc: Linear resolution of the images to produce. It is assumed to have a equal number of pixels in ra and dec.
  image_name:
    default: image_t%t.fits
    type: string
    doc: Image name format. The %t will be replaced with the time sample id.
  dl:
    default: 0.0
    type: double
    doc: Offset in l of the phase center.
  dm:
    default: 0.0
    type: double
    doc: Offset in m of the phase center.
  scale:
    default: -1.0
    type: double
    doc: Scale in degrees of the pixel. If -1 is provided it will choose a suitable scale to fit the whole sky.
  proxy_type:
    default: CPU_OPTIMIZED
    type: enum
    symbols: CPU_OPTIMIZED, CUDA_GENERIC, CPU_REFERENCE, HYBRID
    doc: >-
      Type of algorithm to do the gridding with IDG. The options are  `CPU_OPTIMIZED`, `CUDA_GENERIC`, `CPU_REFERENCE` or 
      `HYBRID`. Note that `CUDA_GENERIC` and `HYBRID` have to make use of a CUDA compatible GPU.
