  | Splits the data stream into multiple different streams.
    Processes each split stream with different settings.
  | *Warning:* The split step must be the last step in a list of successive steps.
    Specifying steps that follow the 'split' step is only possible using
    the 'steps' settings of the split step. For example, use
    ``steps=[predict,split] split.steps=[average,out]``.

inputs:
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'split'.
  steps:
    default: "[]"
    type: array of strings
    doc: List steps that follow the 'split' step, e.g. ``[average, msout]``.
      Split creates multiple pipelines with these steps, using the
      replaceparms setting.
  replaceparms:
    default: "[]"
    type: array of strings
    doc: >-
      A list of key names that are different for each of the next steps.
      The keys that are specified in this list should themselves be given as a
      list of parameters.
      E.g., for ``split.replaceparms=[average.timestep, msout.name]``,
      ``average.timestep`` and ``msout.name`` should now be specified as arrays,
      e.g. ``average.timestep=[1, 4]``.
      The keywords that are specified by split.replaceparms determine
      the number of streams that the input is split into.
      In the above example, there will be two streams because
      ``average.timestep`` lists two values.
      All other specified keywords should also list two values.
