  Instead of reading input from a measurement set on disk, read input from a stream on a socket. To enable this operation, the parset keys 'msin' or 'msin.name' should not be defined.
inputs:
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'svpinput'.
  steps:
    default: "[]"
    type: array of strings
    doc: List steps that follow the 'svpinput' step, e.g. ``[average, msout]``.
     Any such steps can be applied to the data stream that is read from the socket.
  socket:
    default: "/tmp/svpsock0"
    type: string
    doc: Unix socket path to read data (must be created by the client writing the data to this socket).
