description: >-
  Detect outliers on antenna or station level based on statistical properties of the visibility
  data. If an antenna or station is found to be an outlier, all baselines involving this antenna or
  station are flagged. The outlier detection is repeated for every time step in the input. This step
  preserves any pre-existing flags, but does not take them into account when computing statistics
  or detecting outliers. This step is mainly intended for processing of AARTFAAC
  data, where antennas in a station are used individually. To manually specify
  an antenna to be flagged, you can use the PreFlagger step with the
  baseline selection option with a single antenna name `.`

inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step `.`
    default: antennaflagger
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'antennaflagger' (or 'antflag') `.`
    default: antennaflagger
  antenna_flagging_sigma:
    default: 3
    type: float
    doc: >-
      Flag an antenna when the statistical properties of its data exceeds this threshold.
  antenna_flagging_max_iterations:
    default: 5
    type: int
    doc: >-
      Detecting outliers is an iterative process where in every iteration, only the unflagged
      data is analyzed. This parameter controls the maximum number of iterations in the antenna
      flagging stage `.`
  station_flagging_sigma:
    default: 2.5
    type: float
    doc: >-
      Flag all antennas for a station when the statistical properties of its
      data exceeds this threshold `.`
  station_flagging_max_iterations:
