  "Predict visibilities based on input images using wgridder"
inputs:
  type:
    default: "\"\""
    type: string
    doc: must be 'wgridderpredict' (case insensitive).
  images:
    default: "[]"
    type: list
    doc: Filename of ``.fits`` model images, one per frequency term. The terms are defined as for a polynomial source spectra (not logarithmic), e.g. see `this WSClean page <https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component_list.html>`__. The frequency in the metadata of the fits files is used as nu<sub>0</sub> in the polynomial evaluation.
  regions:
    default: "\"\""
    type: string
    doc: DS9 regions file describing the facets for prediction.
  savefacets:
    default: false
    type: bool
    doc: Write out each facet as a fits file (named facet<N>.fits).
  sumfacets:
    default: false
    type: bool
    doc: Sum visibilities for all facets. The default, false, means that visibilities are stored per facet, for example for use in DDECal.
