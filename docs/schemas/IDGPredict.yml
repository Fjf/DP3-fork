inputs:
  type:
    default: "\"\""
    type: string
    doc: must be 'idgpredict' (case insensitive).
  images:
    default: "[]"
    type: list
    doc: Filename of ``.fits`` model images, one per frequency term. The terms are defined as for a polynomial source spectra (not logarithmic), e.g. see `this WSClean page <https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/component_list.html>`__. The frequency in the metadata of the fits files is used as nu<sub>0</sub> in the polynomial evaluation.
  regions:
    default: "\"\""
    type: string
    doc: DS9 regions file describing the facets for IDG prediction.
  savefacets:
    default: false
    type: bool
    doc: Write out each facet as a fits file (named facet<N>.fits).
  aterms:
    default: []
    type: bool
    doc: List of aterm names to use.
  saveaterms:
    default: false
    type: bool
    doc: Save the aterms to disk.
  atermkernelsize:
    default: 16
    type: integer
    doc: Kernel size to use for determining aterms. See `this WSClean page <https://wsclean.readthedocs.io/en/latest/idg_a_term_correction.html#kernel-size>`__.
  aterm&#46;type:
    default: aterms name paramater
    type: string
    doc: Use as `atermname.type`, where atermname is the name from the aterms parameter. Type can be one of the following `beam`.
  beam&#46;frequency_interpolation:
    default: true
    type: bool
    doc: Used in combination with an aterm of type (or name) ``beam``.
  beam&#46;differential:
    default: false
    type: bool
    doc: Used in combination with an aterm of type (or name) ``beam``.
  beam&#46;usechannelfreq:
    default: false
    type: bool
    doc: Used in combination with an aterm of type (or name) ``beam``.
  beam&#46;element_response_model:
    default: hamaker
