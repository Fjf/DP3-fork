  Run a user defined python step. Parameters are passed to python.
  To make a python step work, make sure that the python libraries of DPPP are
  in the python path, e.g. by setting

  .. code-block:: sh

      export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/dp3/lib64/python3.6/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH

  The example below shows a minimal example of a python step.

  .. include:: ../../DPPP/test/unit/mock/mockpystep.py
     :code: python

  **Note**: :code:`import dppp` does not work from a python interpreter directly, it only works if the python code is run by DPPP.

   For a complete list of DPPP functions available in python see the source code of pydppp.cc

inputs:
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be :code:`python` or :code:`pythondppp` `.`
  python.module:
    type: string
    doc: Name of the module where the python code lives. Typically this is the file name of the python code, which should be in the python path. E.g. if your code is in :code:`mockpystep.py` in the working directory, set :code:`module` to :code:`mockpystep`.
  python.class:
    type: string
    doc: Name of the python class that subclasses the DPStep. In the example above, this should be :code:`MockPyStep`.
