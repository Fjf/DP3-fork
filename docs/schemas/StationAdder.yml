description: >-
  Combine multiple stations together into one larger station by adding the visibilities together.
  A common use case for this is to add the core stations on the superterp station together.
  It decreases the number of visibilities and therefore the computational cost of subsequent
  processing, and for some calibration approaches it may also be
  useful to have a station with a larger signal to noise.
  Be aware that the new station has a smaller beam than the original stations.
inputs:
  step_name:
    type: string
    doc: unique name for the step.
    default: stationadder
  type:
    type: string
    doc: Case-insensitive step type; must be 'stationadder'.
    default: stationadder
  stations:
    type: record
    doc: >-
      One or more names of new stations each followed by the list of
      stations it consists of. A station name in the list can be a
      glob-like pattern. Optionally such a pattern can be negated by a
      ! or ^ meaning that names matching that pattern are excluded from
      the selection so far. For example:
      ``stations={ST6:'CS00[2-7]*'}`` can be used to form the superstation from
      all superterp stations. ``{ST6:['CS00[2-7]*','!CS005*']}`` is similar,
      but excludes CS005. ``{ST001:[CS001,CS002,CS003], ST002:[CS004,CS005,CS006]}``
      defines 2 new stations ST001 and ST002
      consisting of the stations in the lists following their names.
  minpoints:
    default: 1
    type: integer
    doc: >-
      Flag a new data point if number of unflagged data points
      added is less than ``minpoints``.
  useweights:
    default: true
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      Use the input data weights? False means all input visibilities
      have weight 1.
  average:
    default: true
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      Is a visibility of a new station the weighted average of its input
      visibilities and its UVW the weighted average of the input UVWs?
  autocorr:
    default: false
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
      Form new auto-correlations?
  sumauto :
    default: true
    type: boolean
    doc: >-
       If ``true``, form new auto-correlations based on existing autocorrelations.
       If ``false``, use the cross-correlations to form new auto-correlations.
